Task 6

# Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength.

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

### Tools Used

-  Online free password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com).
## Steps

Below are the key steps taken in this process:

### 1. Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.

Examples:

- Weak: 12345, password, qwerty

- Medium: Abhi1234

- Strong: A8hi!T#2025

- Very Strong: P@55w0rd!Secur3_2025X



### 2. Test each password on password strength checker.

used sites like Kaspersky Password Checker

### 3. Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.

- Mix uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols.

- Use at least 12–16 characters.

- Avoid dictionary words or personal info.

- Use passphrases (e.g., Coffee!Rain#Sunset@2025).

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.



### 4. Stop capture after a minute.

- Use long passwords (at least 12–16 characters).

- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.

- Avoid using common words, names, or predictable patterns.

- Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts.

- Prefer passphrases (a sequence of random words with symbols) for easier memorization.

- Regularly update passwords and change them if compromised.

- Always enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra security.


### 5. Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary)

- Brute Force → Trying all possible combinations.

- Dictionary Attack → Using wordlists of common passwords.

- Credential Stuffing → Using leaked username/passwords.

- Phishing → Tricking users into revealing passwords.



### 5. Summarize how password complexity affects security.


- Weak passwords → Easily cracked by brute force or dictionary attacks.

- Medium passwords → Slightly better but still guessable with modern tools.

- Strong passwords → Longer cracking times, more resistance to brute force.

- Very strong passwords + MFA → Highly secure, reduces chances of compromise.




### 5. Conclusion

By testing different passwords, I learned how complexity (length, character variety, randomness) directly impacts security. Strong passwords make brute-force and dictionary attacks impractical. Adopting best practices like long passphrases and MFA significantly enhances account protection.
